# Data Structures Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for the data structure assignments. The repository includes 6 different main programs, each serving a different purpose.

## Description

I have implemented various data structures in this homework to solve different problems. Each main program demonstrates the usage and functionality of a specific data structure.


- Main 1: Linked List Operations  
  This program creates a stack data structure that contains random numbers. It then prompts the user to enter a number and search for that number within the created stack.

- Main 2: Stack Operations  
  This program creates a queue with 100 random elements, prints the queue, and checks if a user-input element is present in the queue.
  
- Main 3: Queue Operations  
  This program creates a queue consisting of 100 random numbers, prints the data in the queue to the screen, then transfers this data to a stack and prints the data in the stack to the screen.

- Main 4: Binary Search Tree Operations  
  This program creates a linked list and fills it with random numbers. Then, it prompts the user to enter a number and finds the position of that number in the list.

- Main 5: Graph Algorithms  
  This program demonstrates the usage of different sorting algorithms and compares the performance of these algorithms by calculating their time complexities and the number of array accesses during sorting operations.

- Main 6: Sorting Algorithms  
  This program determines if a graph can be drawn based on the given degree sequence.
